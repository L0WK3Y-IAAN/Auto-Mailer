AUTOMAILER by: L0WK3Y

[+] Are you annoyed with the tedious task of sending repetative daily emails? Use Automailer!
 
This script can be used to automatically send scheduled emails to any email of your choosing. 
Since I was not planning on releasing this publicly, a few of the variables are hard coded. 
I will change the variables to take user-input in a future release, or you can change them until then with this source code.


Uses following packages:

Schedule: #https://pypi.org/project/schedule/
Twilio: #https://pypi.org/project/twilio/

Enjoy :)
